# Unity3D-ProceduralMaze-Pathfinding

This repository hosts a Unity project featuring dynamically generated 3D mazes and an A* pathfinding algorithm, encapsulated within DLL files. The project demonstrates the power of procedural generation in game development and the efficiency of A* pathfinding in navigating complex environments.

## Overview

The key components of this project are:

1. **3D Procedural Maze Generator**: A dynamic maze generator that creates intricate and unique 3D mazes every time the game is played. 
2. **A* Pathfinding Algorithm**: An implementation of the A* algorithm for efficient navigation through the maze, optimized for performance in the Unity3D environment.

## Features

- **Dynamic Maze Creation**: Experience a new maze in each game session, showcasing the versatility of procedural content generation.
- **Efficient Pathfinding**: The A* algorithm is fine-tuned for 3D spaces, ensuring smooth and logical navigation for in-game characters.
- **Unity Integration**: Both the maze generator and pathfinding algorithm are packaged as DLLs for easy integration and usage in Unity projects.

## Getting Started

To use these DLLs in your Unity project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Copy the DLL files into your Unity project's `Assets` folder.
3. In Unity, navigate to the `Assets` folder and ensure that the DLLs are recognized correctly.

## Usage

- **Maze Generation**: Call the appropriate functions from `MazeGenerator.dll` to create a maze.
- **Pathfinding**: Utilize `AStarPathfinding.dll` to find the optimal path through the maze.

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome, whether it's enhancing the maze generation algorithm, optimizing the pathfinding, or improving the overall integration with Unity.
